    "•\tHours Studied (X1): The total number of hours spent studying by each student.\n",
    "•\tPrevious Scores (X2): The scores obtained by students in previous tests.\n",
    "•\tExtracurricular Activities (X3): Whether the student participates in extracurricular activities (Yes: 1 or No: 0).\n",
    "•\tSleep Hours (X4): The average number of hours of sleep the student had per day.\n",
    "•\tSample Question Papers Practiced (X5): The number of sample question papers the student had practiced.\n",
    "•\tPerformance Index (X6): A measure of the overall performance of each student.\n",

    "a)\tLoad the CSV file for the dataset.\t(5 marks)\n",
    "b)\tApply linear regression model based on the number of independent variables available in the dataset.\t(30 marks)\n",
    "c)\tPresent the correlation between the independent variable and the dependent variable by plotting a scatter plot. These independent variables include X1, X2, and X4. Add the regression line (colored in red) in each plot.\t(30 marks)\n",
    "d)\tApply multiple linear regression model which including all the independent variable available. Using your model, predict the Performance Index of new student who has the following factors:\n",
